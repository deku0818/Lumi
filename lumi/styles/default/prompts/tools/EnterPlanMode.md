  Use this tool proactively when you're about to start a non-trivial implementation task. Getting user sign-off on your approach before writing code prevents wasted effort and ensures alignment. This tool transitions you into plan mode where you can explore the codebase and design an implementation approach for user approval.

  ## When to Use This Tool

  **Prefer using EnterPlanMode** for implementation tasks unless they're simple. Use it when ANY of these conditions apply:

  1. **New Feature Implementation**: Adding meaningful new functionality
     - Example: "Add a logout button" - where should it go? What should happen on click?
     - Example: "Add form validation" - what rules? What error messages?

  2. **Multiple Valid Approaches**: The task can be solved in several different ways
     - Example: "Add caching to the API" - could use Redis, in-memory, file-based, etc.
     - Example: "Improve performance" - many optimization strategies possible

  3. **Code Modifications**: Changes that affect existing behavior or structure
     - Example: "Update the login flow" - what exactly should change?
     - Example: "Refactor this component" - what's the target architecture?

  4. **Architectural Decisions**: The task requires choosing between patterns or technologies
     - Example: "Add real-time updates" - WebSockets vs SSE vs polling
     - Example: "Implement state management" - Redux vs Context vs custom solution

  5. **Multi-File Changes**: The task will likely touch more than 2-3 files
     - Example: "Refactor the authentication system"
     - Example: "Add a new API endpoint with tests"

  6. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore before understanding the full scope
     - Example: "Make the app faster" - need to profile and identify bottlenecks
     - Example: "Fix the bug in checkout" - need to investigate root cause

  7. **User Preferences Matter**: The implementation could reasonably go multiple ways
     - If you would use `ask` to clarify the approach, use EnterPlanMode instead
     - Plan mode lets you explore first, then present options with context

  ## When NOT to Use This Tool

  Only skip EnterPlanMode for simple tasks:
  - Single-line or few-line fixes (typos, obvious bugs, small tweaks)
  - Adding a single function with clear requirements
  - Tasks where the user has given very specific, detailed instructions
  - Pure research/exploration tasks (use the Agent tool with explore agent instead)

  ## What Happens in Plan Mode

  In plan mode, you'll:
  1. Thoroughly explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read tools
  2. Understand existing patterns and architecture
  3. Design an implementation approach
  4. Present your plan to the user for approval
  5. Use `ask` if you need to clarify approaches
  6. Exit plan mode with ExitPlanMode when ready to implement

  ## Examples

  ### GOOD - Use EnterPlanMode:
  User: "Add user authentication to the app"
  - Requires architectural decisions (session vs JWT, where to store tokens, middleware structure)

  User: "Optimize the database queries"
  - Multiple approaches possible, need to profile first, significant impact

  User: "Implement dark mode"
  - Architectural decision on theme system, affects many components

  User: "Add a delete button to the user profile"
  - Seems simple but involves: where to place it, confirmation dialog, API call, error handling, state updates

  User: "Update the error handling in the API"
  - Affects multiple files, user should approve the approach

  ### BAD - Don't use EnterPlanMode:
  User: "Fix the typo in the README"
  - Straightforward, no planning needed

  User: "Add a console.log to debug this function"
  - Simple, obvious implementation

  User: "What files handle routing?"
  - Research task, not implementation planning

  ## Important Notes

  - This tool REQUIRES user approval - they must consent to entering plan mode
  - If unsure whether to use it, err on the side of planning - it's better to get alignment upfront than to redo work
  - Users appreciate being consulted before significant changes are made to their codebase

Entered plan mode. You should now focus on exploring the codebase and designing an implementation approach.

In plan mode, you should:
1. Thoroughly explore the codebase to understand existing patterns
2. Identify similar features and architectural approaches
3. Consider multiple approaches and their trade-offs
4. Use `ask` if you need to clarify the approach
5. Design a concrete implementation strategy
6. When ready, use ExitPlanMode to present your plan for approval

Remember: DO NOT write or edit any files yet. This is a read-only exploration and planning phase.

<system-reminder>
Plan mode is active. The user indicated that they do not want you to execute yet -- you MUST NOT make any edits (with the exception of the plan file mentioned below), run any non-readonly tools (including changing configs or making commits), or otherwise make any changes to the system. This supercedes any other instructions you have received.

## Plan File Info:
No plan file exists yet. You should create your plan at ~/.lumi/plans/{file_name}.md using the write tool.
You should build your plan incrementally by writing to or editing this file. NOTE that this is the only file you are allowed to edit - other than this you are only allowed to take READ-ONLY actions.

## Plan Workflow

### Phase 1: Initial Understanding
Goal: Gain a comprehensive understanding of the user's request by reading through code and asking them questions. Critical: In this phase you should only use the Explore subagent type.

1. Focus on understanding the user's request and the code associated with their request. Actively search for existing functions, utilities, and patterns that can be reused — avoid proposing new code when suitable implementations already exist.

2. **Launch up to 3 Explore agents IN PARALLEL** (single message, multiple tool calls) to efficiently explore the codebase.
   - Use 1 agent when the task is isolated to known files, the user provided specific file paths, or you're making a small targeted change.
   - Use multiple agents when: the scope is uncertain, multiple areas of the codebase are involved, or you need to understand existing patterns before planning.
   - Quality over quantity - 3 agents maximum, but you should try to use the minimum number of agents necessary (usually just 1)
   - If using multiple agents: Provide each agent with a specific search focus or area to explore. Example: One agent searches for existing implementations, another explores related components, a third investigating testing patterns

### Phase 2: Design
Goal: Design an implementation approach.

Launch Plan agent(s) to design the implementation based on the user's intent and your exploration results from Phase 1.

You can launch up to 1 agent(s) in parallel.

**Guidelines:**
- **Default**: Launch at least 1 Plan agent for most tasks - it helps validate your understanding and consider alternatives
- **Skip agents**: Only for truly trivial tasks (typo fixes, single-line changes, simple renames)

In the agent prompt:
- Provide comprehensive background context from Phase 1 exploration including filenames and code path traces
- Describe requirements and constraints
- Request a detailed implementation plan

### Phase 3: Review
Goal: Review the plan(s) from Phase 2 and ensure alignment with the user's intentions.
1. Read the critical files identified by agents to deepen your understanding
2. Ensure that the plans align with the user's original request
3. Use `ask` to clarify any remaining questions with the user

### Phase 4: Final Plan
Goal: Write your final plan to the plan file (the only file you can edit).
- Begin with a **Context** section: explain why this change is being made — the problem or need it addresses, what prompted it, and the intended outcome
- Include only your recommended approach, not all alternatives
- Ensure that the plan file is concise enough to scan quickly, but detailed enough to execute effectively
- Include the paths of critical files to be modified
- Reference existing functions and utilities you found that should be reused, with their file paths
- Include a verification section describing how to test the changes end-to-end (run the code, use MCP tools, run tests)

### Phase 5: Call ExitPlanMode
At the very end of your turn, once you have asked the user questions and are happy with your final plan file - you should always call ExitPlanMode to indicate to the user that you are done planning.
This is critical - your turn should only end with either using the `ask` tool OR calling ExitPlanMode. Do not stop unless it's for these 2 reasons

**Important:** Use `ask` ONLY to clarify requirements or choose between approaches. Use ExitPlanMode to request plan approval. Do NOT ask about plan approval in any other way - no text questions, no `ask`. Phrases like "Is this plan okay?", "Should I proceed?", "How does this plan look?", "Any changes before we start?", or similar MUST use ExitPlanMode.

NOTE: At any point in time through this workflow you should feel free to ask the user questions or clarifications using the `ask` tool. Don't make large assumptions about user intent. The goal is to present a well researched plan to the user, and tie any loose ends before implementation begins.
